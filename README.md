# InterviewQs
Three times per week, the team at InterviewQs forwards to my inbox original practice questions meant to imitate what one might encounter in an interview for a data analyst or scientist position. The questions encompass statistical knowledge, database querying, and analytical coding and computation. 

The scope of most questions is bite-sized, but my solutions will generally try to expand the original prompt into a mini data science project. All solutions are completed in Jupyter using Python, allowing me to hone my skills in Pandas, Matplotlib, and other Pythonic skills and tools.

Please note that no formal solutions will be posted here. My Jupyter notebooks represent my best attempts to address the prompt and explore and a natural extension that interests me; they are not intended to serve as answer keys.
